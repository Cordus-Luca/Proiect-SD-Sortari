# Sorting Algorithm testing

This program tests the speed of various sorting algorithms on different types of arranged arrays.

Test type:
ASC = Almost sorted | 
ASD = Almost sorted descending | 
R = Random | 
C = Constant

Sorting Algorithm:
B = BubbleSort | 
C = CountSort | 
R = RadixSort | 
M = MergeSort | 
Q = QuickSort | 
L = Integrated sorting function
